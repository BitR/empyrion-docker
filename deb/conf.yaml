### Dedicated server settings
### To use your own dedicated.yaml (e.g., "MyDedicatedConfig.yaml"), add "-dedicated MyDedicatedConfig.yaml" to the corresponding batch file

ServerConfig:
    Srv_Port: 30000
    Srv_Name: My Server
    # Srv_Password: Abc # Only use with public servers (not for Local Coop)
    # Srv_MaxPlayers: 8

    # Idle playfield servers held in reserve. For busy public servers, we recommend at least 2 (default = 1)
    # Valid range: 0..10
    # Srv_ReservePlayfields: 1

    ### Server description shown in Server Browser
    ### max 127 chars: "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
    # Srv_Description: "Server info, can contain [b]bold[/b] text or a [u][url=empyriongame.com]link[/url][/u]."

    ### Set the following parameter to false (or comment the line out) if you want to hide your server in the Server Browser 
    ### If server is not visible you can connect via IP or via joining a friend's game.
    Srv_Public: true

    ### All playfield servers will be automatically stopped every <n> real time hours. Players will get some warning messages before
    # Srv_StopPeriod: 48

    ### Activate Telnet server
    # Tel_Enabled: true   
    # Tel_Port: 30004
    # Tel_Pwd: Abc

    ### Activate Easy Anti Cheat (clients have to enable EAC via Options -> Misc to connect to a EAC protected server)
    EACActive: true

    ### Location of save game folder    
    # SaveDirectory: Saves

    ### Restrict allowed Blueprint size class: restricted types are not allowed to be produced or spawned
    # 1 = allow only small blueprints, ... , 10 = allow very large blueprints, ..., 50 = allow gigantic blueprints, ... , 0 = no limits
    ### Warning: large blueprints can have very strong performance impact!
    MaxAllowedSizeClass: 10

    ### Restrict Blueprint types allowed for production in factory
    ### None      = Blueprint system completely disabled
    ### StockOnly = only stock blueprints can be produced
    ### All       = all types allowed (default)
    AllowedBlueprints: All

    ### Timeout in seconds after which a playfield server process will be killed (and all players on it disconnected) if it does no longer send heartbeat messages to the dedi 
    ### Set 0 to disable this feature
    HeartbeatServer: 15

    ### Timeout in seconds after which a client will be disconnected if it does no longer send heartbeat messages to the dedi
    ### Set 0 to disable this feature
    # HeartbeatClient: 30

    ### Enable extra log outputs (for debugging purposes)
    ### Defined flags: (add together the values if more than one group should be active at the same time)
    ### 0 = no extra logs
    ### 1 = EAC
    ### 2 = EAC_all_details (includes EAC - Note: this generates a lot of log lines)
    # LogFlags: 0

    ### Uncomment the following line if you want to prohibit Steam Family Sharers playing (only the game owner can then play)
    # DisableSteamFamilySharing: True

    ### Players with a ping higher than the value specified below will be locked out of the game. We recommend to not allow too high pings as this can result in player cheating
    # KickPlayerWithPing: 300

    ### Monitors booting playfield server processes, kills them if they time out (time in seconds, 0 = disabled)
    ### Note: This is a conservative default, for faster servers 60 seconds should be ok
    TimeoutBootingPfServer: 90
    
    ### If specified, the number of parallel logins to a server are restricted to this number. This is important when you expect a big number of people to login at the same time
    # PlayerLoginParallelCount: 5
    ### Add steam ids for preferred players that will get a better position in the login queue
    # PlayerLoginVipNames: "123456789,123456788,123456787"

    ### Enable if hosted scenario should use DLC features - NOTE: all players that want to join the server need to own the DLC
    # EnableDLC: true


GameConfig:
    GameName: DediGame                       # Determines name of the save game 
    Mode: Survival                           # Survival or Creative
    Seed: 1011345                            # The seed determines how the world is procedurally generated - the same seed means the same world
    CustomScenario: Default Multiplayer      # Enable custom scenario. Name of custom scenario from folder Content\Scenarios

    # SharedData transfer via cloud storage
    # Since the in-game transfer is slow and costs a lot of dedi server bandwidth, you can now use a cloud storage service.
    #
    # How to use:
    # - zip the complete SharedData folder of the hosted scenario and upload the zip file to a cloud service
    #   - side note: the name of the zip file doesn't matter, you can use the scenario name or add date or version info if you like
    # - ! enable sharing for the uploaded file so that everyone with a sharing link can download it !
    # - create the sharing link for the zip file and set it below as SharedDataURL parameter
    #   - Note: when that parameter exists, the old in-game transfer is disabled
    #
    # Notes:
    # - usually the link URL from the cloud service is a "view URL" => when you paste it into your browser a page opens with a Download button somewhere
    # - since we need to directly download the file, we internally convert the "view URL" into a "download URL"
    # - this currently works for "Google Drive", "OneDrive" (Personal variant) and DropBox
    # - if you want to use another service, you need to get a "download URL" yourself
    #   - also set that as SharedDataURL parameter but prefix it with an underscore '_' to mark it as such

    # !!! Please DON'T FORGET to update the URL when you upload a new version of your zip file !!!

    # Google Drive example
    # SharedDataURL: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xxxxxxxxxxK/view?usp=sharing

    # Example for a "download URL" - notice the leading underscore character
    # SharedDataURL: _https://anotherservice.com/abc123
